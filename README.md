# RESTful-Concepts
This repository showcases my hands-on learning and application of RESTful concepts, covering CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, and route handling (Index, Create, Show, Update, Edit, and Destroy). It also includes features like redirects and UUID generation, demonstrating practical backend development skills.
