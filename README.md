# RESTful-Concepts

This repository documents my journey of learning and applying RESTful concepts. I explored and implemented key REST principles, including:

🌐 Understanding REST: Gained a solid foundation in REST architecture and its core principles.

🔥 CRUD Operations: Applied Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to build functional APIs.

⚙️ Creating RESTful APIs: Developed RESTful APIs with proper route structuring and data handling.

📄 Index, Create, Show, Update, Edit, and Destroy Routes: Implemented and tested the full range of RESTful routes.

🔀 Redirects: Practiced handling redirects effectively within the routes.

🔑 UUID Generation: Worked with unique ID creation for resource identification.

💡 This repository serves as a reference point for others looking to understand and build RESTful APIs, while also showcasing my hands-on experience with backend development concepts.
